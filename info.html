                <h3>So, who am I?....</h3>
                <p>
                    I am Lian, protector of the staffy galaxy, born in a different tropical world dimension, traveled half of the world to be in the north, where I ran into---- 
                </p> <br>
                <p><i>Just kidding!</i> Seriously, I am Lian from the beautiful tropical country called The Philippines. Since I moved to Sweden, I have been working with different small jobs: from dog walking, dog sitting, foodtruck staff, cleaning, and a manager at a cafe. 
                I do like working in a kitchen, but since pandemic came, I had this realization that I cannot just depend on these jobs. I need to change my career. Front-end web developer. I got inspired by my partner who also works as a web developer. It's fun to create websites, and see the finish product. Of course, it's not always sunshine and happiness, but as we all know, in every rain, a rainbow comes after. I think the same way in programming. It is hard, but it is worth it. </p>
