# My First ever Photo Gallery Website

Hi There! This is the first ever webpage I made, and it consists of HTML and CSS.  
I really enjoyed making this fun project as I get to use HTML and CSS for the first time, and I get to show you what I do outside programming. :) 

Feel free to check out my other repos! and here's a link to my LinkedIn: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/liandelacruz/`
